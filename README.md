- Normal pieces can move into open forward diagonal square (Normal Move)
- King pieces can move forwards and backwards (Normal King Move)
- If a normal piece makes it to the opponents back row, then it becomes a king 
- All pieces can capture an opponet's piece if there is an open space behind the piece (Normal Jump)
